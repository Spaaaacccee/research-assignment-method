This page trains an evolutionary neural network to make decisions as
an investor with stock prices from 50 of the top ASX companies from
2021-05-05 to 2021-05-13, along with up to 100 Twitter posts for
each.

Investors are granted vision (shown by the edges of graph) as well
as memory. A green dot indicates they have decided to buy, and a red
dot indicates they have decided to sell.

The size of the dot indicates their current profit. Investors also
make posts, with their sentiment indicated by a happy/sad emoji.
